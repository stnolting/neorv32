# Processor Memory Source Files

This folder provides the architecture-only VHDL sources for the processor-internal memories
(instruction memory "IMEM", data memory "DMEM"). Different implementations are available - but
only **one** version of each (IMEM and DMEM) has to be added as actual source files.

For the first implementation the `*.default.vhd` files should be selected. The HDL style for describing
memories used by these files has proven **platform-independence** across several FPGA architectures and toolchains.

If synthesis fails to infer actual block RAM resources from these default files, try the legacy `*.cyclone2.vhd` files, which
provide a different HDL style. These files are intended for legacy support of older Intel/Altera Quartus versions (13.0 and older). However,
these files do **not** use platform-specific macros or primitives - so they might also work for other FPGAs and toolchains.

:warning: Make sure to add the selected files from this folder also to the `neorv32` design library.
