|=======================

The SLINK component provides up to 8 independent RX (receiving) and TX (sending) links for transmitting
stream data. The interface provides higher bandwidth (and less latency) than the external memory bus
interface, which makes it ideally suited to couple custom stream processing units (like CORDIC, FFTs or
cryptographic accelerators).

Each individual link provides an internal FIFO for data buffering. The FIFO depth is globally defined
for all TX links via the _SLINK_TX_FIFO_ generic and for all RX links via the _SLINK_RX_FIFO_ generic.
The FIFO depth has to be at least 1, which will implement a simple input/output register. The maximum
value is limited to 32768 entries. Note that the FIFO depth has to be a power of two (for optimal
logic mapping).

The actual number of implemented RX/TX links is configured by the _SLINK_NUM_RX_ and _SLINK_NUM_TX_
generics. The SLINK module will be synthesized only if at least one of these generics is greater than
zero. All unimplemented links are internally terminated and their according output signals are pulled
to low level.

[NOTE]
The SLINK interface does not provide any additional tag signals (for example to define a "stream destination
address" or to indicate the last data word of a "package"). Use a custom controller connected
via the external memory bus interface or use some of the processor's GPIO ports to implement custom data
tag signals.

**Theory of Operation**

The SLINK provides eight data registers (`DATA[i]`) to access the links (read accesses will access the RX links, write
accesses will access the TX links), one control register (`CTRL`) and one status register (`STATUS`).

The SLINK is globally activated by setting the control register's enable bit _SLINK_CTRL_EN_. 
The actual data links are accessed by reading or writing the according link data registers `DATA[0]`
to `DATA[7]`. For example, writing the `DATA[0]` will put the according data into the FIFO of TX link 0.
Accordingly, reading from `DATA[0]` will return one data word from the FIFO of RX link 0.

The configuration (done via the SLINK generics) can be checked by software by evaluating bit fields in the
control register. The _SLINK_CTRL_TX_FIFO_Sx_ and _SLINK_CTRL_RX_FIFO_Sx_ indicate the TX & RX FIFO sizes.
The _SLINK_CTRL_TX_NUMx_ and _SLINK_CTRL_RX_NUMx_ bits represent the absolute number of implemented TX and RX links.

The status register shows the FIFO status flags of each RX and TX link. The _SLINK_CTRL_RXx_AVAIL_ flags indicate
that there is _at least_ one data word in the according RX link's FIFO. The _SLINK_CTRL_TXx_FREE_ flags indicate
there is _at least_ one free entry in the according TX link's FIFO. The _SLINK_STATUS_RXx_HALF_ and
_SLINK_STATUS_RXx_HALF_ flags show if a certain FIFO's fill level has exceeded half of its capacity.


**Blocking Link Access**

When directly accessing the link data registers (without checking the according FIFO status flags) the access
is as _blocking_. That means the CPU access will stall until the accessed link responds. For
example, when reading RX link 0 (via `DATA[0]` register) the CPU will stall, if there is not data
available in the according FIFO yet. The CPU access will complete as soon as RX link 0 receives new data.

Vice versa, writing data to TX link 0 (via `DATA[0]` register) will stall the CPU access until there is
at least one free entry in the link's FIFO.

[WARNING]
The NEORV32 processor ensures that _any_ CPU access to memory-mapped devices (including the SLINK module)
will **time out** after a certain number of cycles (see section <<_bus_interface>>).
Hence, blocking access to a stream link that does not complete within a certain amount of cycles will
raise a _store bus access exception_ when writing a _full_ TX link or a _load bus access exception_ when reading
from an _empty_ RX link. Hence, this concept should only be used when evaluating the half-full FIFO condition
(for example via the SLINK interrupts) before actual accessing links.

**Non-Blocking Link Access**

For a non-blocking link access concept, the FIFO status flags in `STATUS` need to be checked _before_
reading/writing the actual link data register. For example, a non-blocking write access to a TX link 0 has
to check _SLINK_STATUS_TX0_FREE_ first. If the bit is set, the FIFO of TX link 0 can take another data word
and the actual data can be written to `DATA[0]`. If the bit is cleared, the link's FIFO is full
and the status flag can be polled until it there is free space in the available.

This concept will not raise any exception as there is no "direct" access to the link data registers.
However, non-blocking accesses require additional instructions to check the according status flags prior
to the actual link access, which will reduce performance for high-bandwidth data streams.

**Interrupts**

The stream interface provides two independent interrupts that are _globally_ driven by the RX and TX link's
FIFO fill level status. The behavior of these interrupts differs if the FIFO depth is exactly 1 (minimal)
or if it is greater than 1.

[NOTE]
If the according interrupt condition is fulfilled, the corresposnding IRQ will become _pending_ until
the causing interrupt conditions is resolved (for example by reading the according RX FIFO).

* When _SLINK_TX_FIFO_ is 1 a TX interrupt will become pending if **any** TX link is _idle_ ("ready to send new data").
* When _SLINK_TX_FIFO_ is greater than 1 the TX interrupt will become pending if **any** TX link's FIFO
is not at least _half_full_ ("still more room for new data to be send").

* When _SLINK_RX_FIFO_ is 1 a RX interrupt will become pending if **any** RX link is has new data that has not
been fetched by the CPU yet ("new incoming data available").
* When _SLINK_RX_FIFO_ is greater than 1 the RX interrupt will become pending if the FIFO of **any** RX
link is at least _half-full_ ("incoming data needs to be read to avoid FIFO overflow").

The interrupt service handler has to evaluate the SLINK status register is order to detect which link(s) has caused the
interrupt. Note that these interrupts can only fire if the SLINK module is actually enabled by setting the
_SLINK_CTRL_EN_ bit in the unit's control register.

**Stream Link Interface & Protocol**

The SLINK interface consists of three signals `dat`, `val` and `rdy` for each RX and TX link.
Each signal is an "array" with eight entires (one for each link). Note that an entry in `slink_*x_dat` is 32-bit
wide while entries in `slink_*x_val` and `slink_*x_rdy` are are just 1-bit wide.

The stream link protocol is based on a simple FIFO-like interface between a source (sender) and a sink (receiver).
Each link provides two signals for implementing a simple FIFO-style handshake. The `slink_*x_val` signal is set by
the source if the according `slink_*x_dat` (also set by the source) contains valid data. The stream source has to 
ensure that both signals remain stable until the according `slink_*x_rdy` signal is set by the stream sink to 
indicate it can accept another data word.

In summary, a data word is transferred if both `slink_*x_val(i)` and `slink_*x_rdy(i)` are high.

[TIP]
The SLINK handshake protocol is compatible with the https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0051/a/Introduction/About-the-AXI4-Stream-protocol[AXI4-Stream] base protocol.
