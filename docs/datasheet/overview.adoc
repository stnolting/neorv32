== Overview

The NEORV32footnote:[Pronounced "neo-R-V-thirty-two" or "neo-risc-five-thirty-two" in its long form.] is an open-source
RISC-V compatible processor system that is intended as *ready-to-go* auxiliary processor within a larger SoC
designs or as stand-alone custom / customizable microcontroller.

The system is highly configurable and provides optional common peripherals like embedded memories,
timers, serial interfaces, general purpose IO ports and an external bus interface to connect custom IP like
memories, NoCs and other peripherals. On-line and in-system debugging is supported by an OpenOCD/gdb
compatible on-chip debugger accessible via JTAG.

Special focus is paid on **execution safety** to provide defined and predictable behavior at any time.
Therefore, the CPU ensures that all memory access are acknowledged and no invalid/malformed instructions
are executed. Whenever an unexpected situation occurs, the application code is informed via hardware exceptions.

The software framework of the processor comes with application makefiles, software libraries for all CPU
and processor features, a bootloader, a runtime environment and several example programs - including a port
of the CoreMark MCU benchmark and the official RISC-V architecture test suite. RISC-V GCC is used as
default toolchain (https://github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt[prebuilt toolchains are also provided]).

=== Rationale

**Why did you make this?**

I am fascinated by processor and CPU architecture design: it is the magic frontier where software meets hardware.
This project has started as something like a _journey_ into this magic realm to understand how things actually work
down on this very low level.

But there is more! When I started to dive into the emerging RISC-V ecosystem I felt overwhelmed by the complexity.
As a beginner it is hard to get an overview - especially when you want to setup a minimal platform to tinker with:
Which core to use? How to get the right toolchain? What features do I need? How does the booting work? How do I
create an actual executable? How to get that into the hardware? How to customize things? **_Where to start???_**

So this project aims to provides a _simple to understand_ and _easy to use_ yet _powerful_ and _flexible_ platform
that targets FPGA and RISC-V beginners as well as advanced users. Join me and us on this journey! ðŸ™ƒ


**Why a _soft_-core processor?**

As a matter of fact soft-core processors _cannot_ compete with discrete or FPGA hard-macro processors in terms
of performance, energy and size. But they do fill a niche in FPGA design space. For example, soft-core processors
allow to implement the _control flow part_ of certain applications (like communication protocol handling) using
software like plain C. This provides high flexibility as software can be easily changed, re-compiled and
re-uploaded again.

Furthermore, the concept of flexibility applies to all aspects of a soft-core processor. The user can add
_exactly_ the features that are required by the application: additional memories, custom interfaces, specialized
IP and even user-defined instructions.


**Why RISC-V?**

[quote, RISC-V International, https://riscv.org/about/]
____
RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.
____

I love the idea of open-source. **Knowledge can help best if it is freely available.**
While open-source has already become quite popular in _software_, hardware projects still need to catch up.
Admittedly, there has been quite a development, but mainly in terms of _platforms_ and _applications_ (so
schematics, PCBs, etc.). Although processors and CPUs are the heart of almost every digital system, having a true
open-source silicon is still a rarity. RISC-V aims to change that. Even it is _just one approach_, it helps paving
the road for future development.

Furthermore, I welcome the community aspect of RISC-V. The ISA and everything beyond is developed with direct
contact to the community: this includes businesses and professionals but also hobbyist, amateurs and people
that are just curious. Everyone can join discussions and contribute to RISC-V in their very own way.

Finally, I really like the RISC-V ISA itself. It aims to be a clean, orthogonal and "intuitive" ISA that
resembles with the basic concepts of _RISC_: simple yet effective.


**Yet another RISC-V core? What makes it special?**

The NEORV32 is not based on another RISC-V core. It was build entirely from ground up (just following the official
ISA specs) having a different design goal in mind. The project does not intend to replace certain RISC-V cores or
just beat existing ones like https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv[VexRISC] in terms of performance or
https://github.com/olofk/serv[SERV] in terms of size.

The project aims to provide _another option_ in the RISC-V / soft-core design space with a different performance
vs. size trade-off and a different focus: _embrace_ concepts like documentation, platform-independence / portability,
RISC-V compatibility, _customization_ and _ease of use_. See the <<_project_key_features>> below.

Furthermore, the NEORV32 pays special focus on _execution safety_ using <<_full_virtualization>>. The CPU aims to
provide fall-backs for _everything that could go wrong_. This includes malformed instruction words, privilege escalations
and even memory accesses that are checked for address space holes and deterministic response times from memory-mapped
devices. Precise exceptions allow a defined and fully-synchronized state of the CPU at every time.

...................................

[NOTE]
The processor-internal instruction and data memories (IMEM and DMEM) are split into two design files each:
a plain entity definition (`neorv32_*mem.entity.vhd`) and the actual architecture definition
(`mem/neorv32_*mem.default.vhd`). The `*.default.vhd` architecture definitions from `rtl/core/mem` provide a _generic_ and
_platform independent_ memory design that (should) infers embedded memory blocks. You can replace/modify the architecture
source file in order to use platform-specific features (like advanced memory resources) or to improve technology mapping
and/or timing.

No HPM counters and no PMP regions were implemented for generating these results.

[TIP]
The CPU provides further options to reduce the area footprint (for example by constraining the CPU-internal
counter sizes) or to increase performance (for example by using a barrel-shifter; at cost of extra hardware).

=== CPU Performance

The performance of the NEORV32 was tested and evaluated using the https://www.eembc.org/coremark/[Core Mark CPU benchmark].
This benchmark focuses on testing the capabilities of the CPU core itself rather than the performance of the whole
system. The according sources can be found in the `sw/example/coremark` folder.

.Dhrystone
[TIP]
A _simple_ port of the Dhrystone benchmark is also available in `sw/example/dhrystone`.

The resulting CoreMark score is defined as CoreMark iterations per second.
The execution time is determined via the RISC-V `[m]cycle[h]` CSRs. The relative CoreMark score is
defined as CoreMark score divided by the CPU's clock frequency in MHz.

|=======================

[NOTE]
The "_performance_" CPU configuration uses the <<_fast_mul_en>> and <<_fast_shift_en>> options.

[NOTE]
The NEORV32 CPU is based on a multi-cycle architecture. Each instruction is executed in a sequence of
several consecutive micro operations.

[NOTE]
The average CPI (cycles per instruction) depends on the instruction mix of a specific applications and also on
the available CPU extensions. The average CPI is computed by dividing the total number of required clock cycles
(only the timed core to avoid distortion due to IO wait cycles) by the number of executed instructions
(`[m]instret[h]` CSRs).

[TIP]
More information regarding the execution time of each implemented instruction can be found in
chapter <<_instruction_timing>>.
