**Key Features**

* Burst-capable tightly-coupled on-chip instruction memory
* Configurable RAM size
* Accessible at the byte level
* Mapped to memory primitives
* Optional output register for improved timing
* Can be implemented as pre-initialized ROM containing application firmware


**Overview**

Implementation of the processor-internal instruction memory is enabled by the processor's
`IMEM_EN` generic. The total memory size in bytes is defined via the `IMEM_SIZE` generic.
Only sizes that are powers of two are supported. If enabled, the IMEM is mapped to base
address `0x00000000` (see section <<_address_space>>).

By default the IMEM is implemented as true RAM so the content can be modified during run time.
Alternatively, the IMEM can be implemented as **pre-initialized read-only memory (ROM)**, so the
processor can directly boot from it after reset. This option is configured via the `BOOT_MODE_SELECT`
generic. See section <<_boot_configuration>> for more information. If the IMEM is implemented as ROM
any write attempt to it will raise a _store access fault_ exception.

The software framework provides an option to generate and override the default VHDL initialization
file `rtl/core/neorv32_imem_image.vhd`, which is automatically inserted into the IMEM (see
<<_makefile_targets>>. If the IMEM is implemented as RAM (default), the memory block will not be
initialized at all.

.Output Register Stage
[TIP]
An optional output register stage can be enabled via `IMEM_OUTREG_EN`. For FPGA targets this might improve
mapping/timing results. Note that this option will increase the read latency by one clock cycle. Write accesses
are not affected by this at all.

.Retrieve Memory Configuration by Software
[TIP]
Software can retrieve the DMEM size from the <<_sysinfo_miscellaneous_configuration>> register.

.Memory Primitives
[TIP]
The memory's memory core is encapsulated as individual wrapper (`neorv32_imem_ram.vhd` / `neorv32_imem_ram.vhd`)
that can be replaced by a technology-specific IP. All interface ports provide static signal widths to ease replacement.
