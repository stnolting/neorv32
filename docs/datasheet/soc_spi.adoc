**Overview**

The NEORV32 SPI module is a **host** transceiver. Hence, it is responsible for generating transmission.
The module operates on a byte.wide data granularity, supports all 4 standard clock modes, a fine-tunable
SPI clock generator and provides up to 8 dedicated chip select signals via the top entity's `spi_csn_o` signal.
An optional receive/transmit ring-buffer/FIFO can be configured via the `IO_SPI_FIFO` generic to support block-based
transmissions without CPU interaction.

.Host-Mode Only
[NOTE]
The NEORV32 SPI module only supports _host mode_. Transmission are initiated only by the processor's SPI module
and not by an external SPI module. If you are looking for a _device-mode_ serial peripheral interface (transactions
initiated by an external host) check out the <<_serial_data_interface_controller_sdi>>.

The SPI module provides a single control register `CTRL` to configure the module and to check it's status
and a single data register `DATA` for receiving/transmitting data.


**Theory of Operation**

The SPI module is enabled by setting the `SPI_CTRL_EN` bit in the `CTRL` control register. No transfer can be initiated
and no interrupt request will be triggered if this bit is cleared. Clearing this bit will reset the entire module, clear
the FIFO and terminate any transfer being in process.

The actual SPI transfer (receiving one byte while sending one byte) as well as control of the chip-select lines is handled
via the module's `DATA` register. Note that this register will access the TX FIFO of the ring-buffer when writing and will
access the RX FIFO of the ring-buffer when reading.

The most significant bit of the `DATA` register (`SPI_DATA_CMD`) is used to select the purpose of the data being written.
When the `SPI_DATA_CMD` is cleared, the lowest 8-bit represent the actual SPI TX data. This data will be transmitted by the
SPI bus engine. After completion, the received data is stored to the RX FIFO.

If `SPI_DATA_CMD` is cleared, the lowest 4-bit control the chip-select lines. In this case, bis `2:0` select one of the eight
chip-select lines. The selected line will become enabled when bit `3` is also set. If bit `3` is cleared, all chip-select
lines will be disabled.

Examples:

* Enable chip-select line 3: `NEORV32_SPI->DATA = (1 << SPI_DATA_CMD) | (1 << 3) | 3;`
* Enable chip-select line 7: `NEORV32_SPI->DATA = (1 << SPI_DATA_CMD) | (1 << 3) | 7;`
* Disable all chip-select lines: `NEORV32_SPI->DATA = (1 << SPI_DATA_CMD) | (0 << 3);`
* Send data byte `0xAB`: `NEORV32_SPI->DATA = (0 << SPI_DATA_CMD) | 0xAB;`

Since all SPI operations are controlled via the FIFO, entire SPI sequences (chip-enable, data transmissions, chip-disable)
can be "programmed". Thus, SPI operations can be executed without any CPU interaction at all.

Application software can check if any chip-select is enabled by reading the control register's `SPI_CS_ACTIVE` flag.


**SPI Clock Configuration**

The SPI module supports all standard SPI clock modes (0, 1, 2, 3), which are configured via the two control register bits
`SPI_CTRL_CPHA` and `SPI_CTRL_CPOL`. The `SPI_CTRL_CPHA` bit defines the _clock phase_ and the `SPI_CTRL_CPOL`
bit defines the _clock polarity_.

The SPI clock frequency (`spi_clk_o`) is programmed by the 3-bit `SPI_CTRL_PRSCx` clock prescaler for a coarse clock selection
and a 4-bit clock divider `SPI_CTRL_CDIVx` for a fine clock configuration.
The following clock prescalers (`SPI_CTRL_PRSCx`) are available:

[cols="<4,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1,^1"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| **`SPI_CTRL_PRSCx`**        | `0b000` | `0b001` | `0b010` | `0b011` | `0b100` | `0b101` | `0b110` | `0b111`
| Resulting `clock_prescaler` |       2 |       4 |       8 |      64 |     128 |    1024 |    2048 |    4096
|=======================

Based on the programmed clock configuration, the actual SPI clock frequency f~SPI~ is derived
from the processor's main clock f~main~ according to the following equation:

_**f~SPI~**_ = _f~main~[Hz]_ / (2 * `clock_prescaler` * (1 + `SPI_CTRL_CDIVx`))

Hence, the maximum SPI clock is f~main~ / 4 and the lowest SPI clock is f~main~ / 131072. The SPI clock is always
symmetric having a duty cycle of exactly 50%.


**High-Speed Mode**

The SPI provides a high-speed mode to further boost the maximum SPI clock frequency. When enabled via the control
register's `SPI_CTRL_HIGHSPEED` bit the clock prescaler configuration (`SPI_CTRL_PRSCx` bits) is overridden setting it
to a minimal factor of 1. However, the clock speed can still be fine-tuned using the `SPI_CTRL_CDIVx` bits.

_**f~SPI~**_ = _f~main~[Hz]_ / (2 * 1 * (1 + `SPI_CTRL_CDIVx`))

Hence, the maximum SPI clock is f~main~ / 2 when in high-speed mode.


**SPI Interrupt**

The SPI module provides a set of programmable interrupt conditions based on the level of the RX/TX FIFO. The different
interrupt sources are enabled by setting the according control register's `SPI_CTRL_IRQ_*` bits. All enabled interrupt
conditions are logically OR-ed, so any enabled interrupt source will trigger the module's interrupt signal.

Once the SPI interrupt has fired it remains pending until the actual cause of the interrupt is resolved; for
example if just the `SPI_CTRL_IRQ_RX_AVAIL` bit is set, the interrupt will keep firing until the RX FIFO is empty again.
