[NOTE]
It is recommended to use the **NEORV32 Processor** as default top instance even if you only want to use the actual
CPU. Simply disable all the processor-internal modules via the generics and you will get a "CPU
wrapper" that provides a minimal CPU environment and an external bus interface (like AXI4). This
setup also allows to further use the default bootloader and software framework. From this base you
can start building your own SoC. Of course you can also use the CPU in it's true stand-alone mode.

[NOTE]
This documentation assumes the reader is familiar with the official RISC-V "User" and "Privileged Architecture" specifications.

=== RISC-V Compatibility

.RISCOF
[NOTE]
https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof[image:https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg[title='github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof']] +
The NEORV32 CPU passes the tests of the **official RISCOF RISC-V Architecture Test Framework**. This framework is used to check
RISC-V implementations for compatibility to the official RISC-V use/privileged ISA specifications. The NEORV32 port of this
test framework is available in a separate repository: https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof



:sectnums:
==== RISC-V Incompatibility Issues and Limitations

This list shows the currently identified issues regarding full RISC-V-compatibility.

.Read-Only "Read-Write" CSRs
[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32 <<_misa>> CSR is _read-only_. Hence, ISA capabilities are fixed at synthesis time and cannot be
enabled/disabled dynamically at runtime. Any machine-mode write access to this CSR is ignored and will _not_
cause any exceptions or side-effects to maintain RISC-V compatibility.

.Physical Memory Protection (PMP)
[IMPORTANT]
The RISC-V-compatible NEORV32 <<_machine_physical_memory_protection_csrs>> only implements the **TOR**
(top of region) mode and only up to 16 PMP regions.

.No Hardware Support of Misaligned Memory Accesses
[IMPORTANT]
The CPU does not support resolving unaligned memory access by the hardware (this is not a
RISC-V-incompatibility issue but an important thing to know!). Any kind of unaligned memory access
will raise an exception to allow a _software-based_ emulation provided by the application.

// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Architecture

The NEORV32 CPU was designed from scratch based only on the official base and privileged ISA
specifications. The following figure shows the simplified data path of the CPU.

image::neorv32_cpu.png[align=center]

The CPU implements a pipelined _multi-cycle_ architecture: each instruction is executed as a series of consecutive
micro-operations. In order to increase performance, the CPU's front-end (instruction fetch) and back-end
(instruction execution) are de-couples via a FIFO. Therefore, the front-end can already fetch new instructions while
the back-end is still processing the previously-fetched instruction.

Basically, the NEORV32 CPU is somewhere between a classical pipelined architecture, where each stage
requires exactly one processing cycle (if not stalled) and a classical multi-cycle architecture, which executes
every single instruction (_including_ fetch) in a series of consecutive micro-operations. The combination of
these two classical design paradigms allows an increased instruction execution in contrast to a pure multi-cycle
approach (due to overlapping operation of fetch and execute) at a reduced hardware footprint (due to the
multi-cycle concept).

As a Von-Neumann machine, the CPU provides independent interfaces for instruction fetch and data access. However,
these two bus interfaces are merged into a single processor-internal bus via a prioritizing bus switch (data accesses
have higher priority). Hence, _all_ memory addresses including peripheral devices are mapped to a single unified 32-bit
address space.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Register File

The data register file contains the general purpose "`x`" architecture registers. For `rv32i` ISA there are 32 32-bit registers
(= 1024 bit total capacity) and for the `rv32e` ISA there are 16 32-bit registers (= 512 bit total capacity). Register zero (`x0`/`zero`)
always read as zero and any write access to it is discarded. 

The register file is implemented as synchronous memory with synchronous read and write accesses. Register `zero` is also mapped to
a _physical memory_ in the register file. By this, there is no need to add a further multiplexer to "insert" zero if reading from
`zero` reducing logic requirements and shortening the critical path. Furthermore, the whole register file can be mapped to FPGA
block RAM(s).

The memory of the register file uses two access ports: a read-only port for reading register `rs2` (second source operand) and a
read/write port reading registers `rs1` (first source operand) or for writing processing results to register `rd` (destination register).
Hence, a _simple_ dual-port RAM can be used to implement the register file. From a functional point of view, read and write accesses to
the register file do never occur in the same clock cycle, so no bypass logic is required at all.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Arithmetic Logic Unit

The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) is used for processing data from the register file and also for memory and branch address computations.
All simple <<_i_base_integer_isa> data processing operations (`add`, `and`, ...) are implemented as combinatorial logic requiring only a single cycle to
complete. More sophisticated instructions (shift operations from the base ISA and all further ISA extensions) are processed by so-called
"ALU co-processors".

The co-processors are implemented as iterative units that require several cycles to complete processing. Besides the base ISA's shift instructions,
the co-processors are used to implement all further processing-based ISA extensions (e.g. <<_m_integer_multiplication_and_division>> and
<<_b_bit_manipulation_operations>>). Custom RISC-V instructions (<<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>>) are also implemented as ALU co-processor.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Bus Unit

The bus unit takes care of handling data memory accesses via the load and store instructions. It handles data adjustment when accessing
sub-word (16-bit or 8-bit) and performs sign-extension for singed load operations. The bus unit also includes the optional includes
<<_pmp_physical_memory_protection>> that performs permission checks for any data and instruction (!) access.

A list of the bus interface signals and a detailed description of the protocol can be found in section <<_bus_interface>>.
All bus interface signals are driven/buffered by registers; so even a complex SoC interconnection bus network will not
effect maximal operation frequency.

.Unaligned Accesses
[WARNING]
The CPU does not support a hardware-based handling of unaligned memory accesses! Any unaligned access will raise a bus load/store unaligned
address exception. The exception handler can be used to _emulate_ unaligned memory accesses in software.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Control Unit

The CPU control unit is the actual brain of the processor core as it generated all the control signals for the different CPU modules.
The control unit is based on several modules (also called "engines").


**Front-End**

The front-end is responsible for fetching instruction data in chunks of 32-bits. This can be one aligned 32-bit instruction,
two aligned 16-bit instructions or a mixture if 32-bit instructions are not aligned to 32-bit boundaries. The instruction
data including control and exception information is stored to a FIFO queue - the instruction prefetch buffer (IPB). The depth
of this FIFO can be configured by the <<_cpu_ipb_entries>> top generic.

The FIFO allows the front-end to do "speculative" instruction fetches, as it keeps fetching the next consecutive instruction
all the time. This also allows to decouple front-end (instruction fetch) and back-end (instruction execution) so both modules
can operate in parallel to increase performance.

.Branch Prediction
[NOTE]
The front-end implements a very simple branch prediction (predict = always taken) that stops fetching further instruction while
a branch/jump/call operation is in progress.


**Back-End**

Instruction data from the instruction prefetch buffer is decompressed (if the `C` ISA extension is enabled) and sent to the
CPU back-end for actual execution. Execution is conducted by a state-machine that controls all of the CPU modules. The execution
time of a instruction depends on the complexity of required operations. The minimal time for executing is 2 cycles (simple ALU
operations) but can be significantly higher. The table in section <<_instruction_timing>> list the required execution times for
all instructions and extensions.


**Trap Controller**

The trap controller handles all synchronous exceptions (caused by an instruction; e.g. an illegal instruction word) and asynchronous
exceptions (= interrupts). A full list of all supported exceptions can be found in section <<_neorv32_trap_listing>>.


**CSR System**

The CSR system implements all the _control and status registers_ and also all hardware counters. See section
<<_control_and_status_registers_csrs>> for a full overview of all available CSRs.


// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Sleep Mode

The NEORV32 CPU provides a single sleep mode that can be entered to power-down the core by reducing dynamic switching activity.

Sleep mode in entered by executing the `wfi` instruction from the <<_zicsr_control_and_status_register_access_privileged_architecture>>
ISA extension. When the CPU is in sleep mode, all CPU-internal operations are stopped (execution, instruction fetch, ...).
Note that this does _not affect_ the operation of any peripheral/IO modules like interfaces and timers. Furthermore,
the CPU will continue to buffer/enqueue all incoming interrupt requests.

The CPU will leave sleep mode as soon as any interrupt source becomes _pending_. This requires that interrupts are globally
enabled by setting `<<_mstatus>>.mie` and that at least one interrupt source is enabled in <<_mie>>.

[IMPORTANT]
If sleep mode is entered without at least one enabled interrupt source the CPU will be _permanently_ halted.

[NOTE]
The CPU automatically wakes up from sleep mode if a debug session via the on-chip debugger is started.


// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Full Virtualization

Just like the RISC-V ISA the NEORV32 aims to provide _maximum virtualization_ capabilities on CPU and SoC level to
allow a high standard of **execution safety**. The CPU supports **all** traps specified by the official RISC-V specifications.
footnote:[If the `Zicsr` CPU extension is enabled (implementing the full set of the privileged architecture).]
Thus, the CPU provides defined hardware fall-backs via traps for any expected and unexpected situation (e.g. executing a
malformed instruction or accessing a non-allocated memory address). For any kind of trap the core is always in a
defined and fully synchronized state throughout the whole architecture (i.e. there are no out-of-order operations that
might have to be reverted). This allows a defined and predictable execution behavior at any time improving overall execution safety.

**Execution Safety - NEORV32 Virtualization Features**

* Due to the acknowledged memory accesses the CPU is _always_ sync with the memory system
(i.e. there is no speculative execution / no out-of-order states).
* The CPU supports _all_ RISC-V compatible bus exceptions including access exceptions, which are triggered if an
accessed address does not respond or encounters an internal device error during access.
* Accessed memory addresses (plain memory, but also memory-mapped devices) need to respond within a fixed time
window. Otherwise a bus access exception is raised.
* The RISC-V specs. state that executing an malformed instruction results in unpredictable behavior. As an additional
execution safety feature the NEORV32 CPU ensures that _all_ unimplemented/malformed/illegal instructions do raise an
illegal instruction exceptions and do not commit any state-changing operation (like writing registers or triggering
memory operations).
* To be continued...

=== CPU Top Entity - Generics

Most of the CPU configuration generics are a subset of the actual Processor configuration generics (see section <<_processor_top_entity_generics>>).
and are not listed here. However, the CPU provides some _specific_ generics that are used to configure the CPU for the
NEORV32 processor setup. These generics are assigned by the processor setup only and are not available for user defined configuration.

=== Instruction Sets and Extensions

The basic NEORV32 is a RISC-V `rv32i` architecture that provides several _optional_ RISC-V CPU and ISA
(instruction set architecture) extensions. For more information regarding the RISC-V ISA extensions please
see the the _RISC-V Instruction Set Manual - Volume I: Unprivileged ISA_ and _The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual
Volume II: Privileged Architecture_, which are available in the projects `docs/references` folder.

.Discovering ISA Extensions
[TIP]
The CPU can discover available ISA extensions via the <<_misa>> & <<_mxisa>> CSRs
or by executing an instruction and checking for an _illegal instruction exception_
(-> <<_full_virtualization>>). +
 +
Executing an instruction from an extension that is not supported yet or that is currently not enabled
(via the according top entity generic) will raise an illegal instruction exception.


==== **`B`** - Bit-Manipulation Operations

The `B` ISA extension adds instructions for bit-manipulation operations. This extension is enabled if the
<<_cpu_extension_riscv_b>> configuration generic is _true_.
The official RISC-V specifications can be found here: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bitmanip

The NEORV32 `B` ISA extension includes the following sub-extensions (according to the RISC-V
bit-manipulation spec. v.093) and their corresponding instructions:

* **`Zba` - Address-generation instructions**
** `sh1add` `sh2add` `sh3add`
* **`Zbb` - Basic bit-manipulation instructions**
** `andn` `orn` `xnor`
** `clz` `ctz` `cpop`
** `max` `maxu` `min` `minu`
** `sext.b` `sext.h` `zext.h`
** `rol` `ror` `rori`
** `orc.b` `rev8`
* **`Zbc` - Carry-less multiplication instructions**
** `clmul` `clmulh` `clmulr`
* **`Zbs` - Single-bit instructions**
** `bclr` `bclri`
** `bext` `bexti`
** `bext` `binvi`
** `bset` `bseti`

[TIP]
By default, the bit-manipulation unit uses an _iterative_ approach to compute shift-related operations
like `clz` and `rol`. To increase performance (at the cost of additional hardware resources) the 
<<_fast_shift_en>> generic can be enabled to implement full-parallel logic (like barrel shifters) for all
shift-related `B` instructions.


==== **`C`** - Compressed Instructions

The _compressed_ ISA extension provides 16-bit encodings of commonly used instructions to reduce code space size.
The `C` extension is available when the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_c>> configuration generic is _true_.
In this case the following instructions are available:

* `c.addi4spn` `c.lw` `c.sw` `c.nop` `c.addi` `c.jal` `c.li` `c.addi16sp` `c.lui` `c.srli` `c.srai` `c.andi` `c.sub`
`c.xor` `c.or` `c.and` `c.j` `c.beqz` `c.bnez` `c.slli` `c.lwsp` `c.jr` `c.mv` `c.ebreak` `c.jalr` `c.add` `c.swsp`

[NOTE]
When the compressed instructions extension is enabled, branches to an _unaligned_ and _uncompressed_ instruction require
an additional instruction fetch to load the according second half-word of that instruction. The performance can be increased
again by forcing a 32-bit alignment of branch target addresses. By default, this is enforced via the GCC `-falign-functions=4`,
`-falign-labels=4`, `-falign-loops=4` and `-falign-jumps=4` compile flags (via the makefile).


==== **`E`** - Embedded CPU

The embedded CPU extensions reduces the size of the general purpose register file from 32 entries to 16 entries to
decrease physical hardware requirements (for example block RAM). This extensions is enabled when the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_e>>
configuration generic is _true_. Accesses to registers beyond `x15` will raise and _illegal instruction exception_.
This extension does not add any additional instructions or features.

[NOTE]
Due to the reduced register file size an alternate toolchain ABI (**`ilp32e`**) is required.


==== **`I`** - Base Integer ISA

The CPU always supports the complete `rv32i` base integer instruction set. This base set is always enabled
regardless of the setting of the remaining exceptions. The base instruction set includes the following
instructions:

* immediate: `lui` `auipc`
* jumps: `jal` `jalr`
* branches: `beq` `bne` `blt` `bge` `bltu` `bgeu`
* memory: `lb` `lh` `lw` `lbu` `lhu` `sb` `sh` `sw`
* alu: `addi` `slti` `sltiu` `xori` `ori` `andi` `slli` `srli` `srai` `add` `sub` `sll` `slt` `sltu` `xor` `srl` `sra` `or` `and`
* environment: `ecall` `ebreak` `fence`

[NOTE]
In order to keep the hardware footprint low, the CPU's shift unit uses a bit-serial approach. Hence, shift operations
take up to 32 cycles (plus overhead) depending on the actual shift amount. Alternatively, the shift operations can be processed
completely in parallel by a fast (but large) barrel shifter if the `FAST_SHIFT_EN` generic is _true_. In that case, shift operations
complete within 2 cycles (plus overhead) regardless of the actual shift amount.

[NOTE]
Internally, the `fence` instruction does not perform any operation inside the CPU. It only sets the
top's `d_bus_fence_o` signal high for one cycle to inform the memory system a `fence` instruction has been
executed. Any flags within the `fence` instruction word are ignore by the hardware.


==== **`M`** - Integer Multiplication and Division

Hardware-accelerated integer multiplication and division operations are available when the
<<_cpu_extension_riscv_m>> configuration generic is _true_. In this case the following instructions are
available:

* multiplication: `mul` `mulh` `mulhsu` `mulhu`
* division: `div` `divu` `rem` `remu`

[NOTE]
By default, multiplication and division operations are executed in a bit-serial approach.
Alternatively, the multiplier core can be implemented using DSP blocks if the <<_fast_mul_en>>
generic is _true_ allowing faster execution. Multiplications and divisions
always require a fixed amount of cycles to complete - regardless of the input operands.

[NOTE]
Regardless of the setting of the <<_fast_mul_en>> generic
multiplication and division instructions operate _independently_ of the input operands.
Hence, there is **no early completion** of multiply by one/zero and divide by zero operations.


==== **`Zmmul`** - Integer Multiplication

This is a _sub-extension_ of the `M` ISA extension. It implements the multiplication-only operations
of the `M` extensions and is intended for size-constrained setups that require hardware-based
integer multiplications but not hardware-based divisions, which will be computed entirely in software.
This extension requires only ~50% of the hardware utilization of the "full" `M` extension.
It is implemented if the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zmmul>> configuration generic is _true_.

* multiplication: `mul` `mulh` `mulhsu` `mulhu`

If `Zmmul` is enabled, executing any division instruction from the `M` ISA extension (`div`, `divu`, `rem`, `remu`)
will raise an _illegal instruction exception_.

Note that `M` and `Zmmul` extensions _cannot_ be enabled at the same time.

[TIP]
If your RISC-V GCC toolchain does not (yet) support the `_Zmmul` ISA extensions, it can be "emulated"
using a `rv32im` machine architecture and setting the `-mno-div` compiler flag
(example `$ make MARCH=rv32im USER_FLAGS+=-mno-div clean_all exe`).


==== **`U`** - Less-Privileged User Mode

In addition to the basic (and highest-privileged) machine-mode, the _user-mode_ ISA extensions adds a second less-privileged
operation mode. It is implemented if the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_u>> configuration generic is _true_.
Code executed in user-mode cannot access machine-mode CSRs. Furthermore, user-mode access to the address space (like
peripheral/IO devices) can be constrained via the physical memory protection (_PMP_).
Any kind of privilege rights violation will raise an exception to allow <<_full_virtualization>>.

Additional CSRs:

* <<_mcounteren>> - machine counter enable to constrain user-mode access to timer/counter CSRs


==== **`X`** - NEORV32-Specific (Custom) Extensions

The NEORV32-specific extensions are always enabled and are indicated by the set `X` bit in the <<_misa>> CSR.

The most important points of the NEORV32-specific extensions are:
* The CPU provides 16 _fast interrupt_ interrupts (`FIRQ`), which are controlled via custom bits in the <<_mie>>
and <<_mip>> CSRs. These extensions are mapped to CSR bits, that are available for custom use according to the
RISC-V specs. Also, custom trap codes for <<_mcause>> are implemented.
* All undefined/unimplemented/malformed/illegal instructions do raise an illegal instruction exception (see <<_full_virtualization>>).
* There are <<_neorv32_specific_csrs>>.


==== **`Zfinx`** Single-Precision Floating-Point Operations

The `Zfinx` floating-point extension is an _alternative_ of the standard `F` floating-point ISA extension.
The `Zfinx` extensions also uses the integer register file `x` to store and operate on floating-point data
instead of a dedicated floating-point register file (hence, `F-in-x`). Thus, the `Zfinx` extension requires
less hardware resources and features faster context changes. This also implies that there are NO dedicated `f`
register file-related load/store or move instructions.
The official RISC-V specifications can be found here: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zfinx

[NOTE]
The NEORV32 floating-point unit used by the `Zfinx` extension is compatible to the _IEEE-754_ specifications.

The `Zfinx` extensions only supports single-precision (`.s` instruction suffix), so it is a direct alternative
to the `F` extension. The `Zfinx` extension is implemented when the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zfinx>> configuration
generic is _true_. In this case the following instructions and CSRs are available:

* conversion: `fcvt.s.w` `fcvt.s.wu` `fcvt.w.s` `fcvt.wu.s`
* comparison: `fmin.s` `fmax.s` `feq.s` `flt.s` `fle.s`
* computational: `fadd.s` `fsub.s` `fmul.s`
* sign-injection: `fsgnj.s` `fsgnjn.s` `fsgnjx.s`
* number classification: `fclass.s`

* compressed instructions: `c.flw` `c.flwsp` `c.fsw` `c.fswsp`

Additional CSRs:

* <<_fcsr>> - FPU control register
* <<_frm>> - rounding mode control
* <<_fflags>> - FPU status flags

[WARNING]
Fused multiply-add instructions `f[n]m[add/sub].s` are not supported!
Division `fdiv.s` and square root `fsqrt.s` instructions are not supported yet!

[WARNING]
Subnormal numbers ("de-normalized" numbers) are not supported by the NEORV32 FPU.
Subnormal numbers (exponent = 0) are _flushed to zero_ setting them to +/- 0 before entering the
FPU's processing core. If a computational instruction (like `fmul.s`) generates a subnormal result, the
result is also flushed to zero during normalization.

[WARNING]
The `Zfinx` extension is not yet officially ratified, but is expected to stay unchanged. There is no
software support for the `Zfinx` extension in the upstream GCC RISC-V port yet. However, an
intrinsic library is provided to utilize the provided `Zfinx` floating-point extension from C-language
code (see `sw/example/floating_point_test`).


==== **`Zicsr`** Control and Status Register Access / Privileged Architecture

The CSR access instructions as well as the exception and interrupt system (= the privileged architecture)
is implemented when the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zicsr>> configuration generic is _true_.

[IMPORTANT]
If the `Zicsr` extension is disabled the CPU does not provide any _privileged architecture_ features at all!
In order to provide the full set of privileged functions that are required to run more complex tasks like
operating system and to allow a secure execution environment the `Zicsr` extension should be always enabled.

In this case the following instructions are available:

* CSR access: `csrrw` `csrrs` `csrrc` `csrrwi` `csrrsi` `csrrci`
* environment: `mret` `wfi`

[NOTE]
If `rd=x0` for the `csrrw[i]` instructions there will be no actual read access to the according CSR.
However, access privileges are still enforced so these instruction variants _do_ cause side-effects
(the RISC-V spec. state that these combinations "_shall_ not cause any side-effects").

.`wfi` Instruction
[NOTE]
The `wfi` instruction is used to enter <<_sleep_mode>>. Executing the `wfi` instruction in user-mode
will raise an illegal instruction exception if <<_mstatus>>`.TW` is set.


==== **`Zicntr`** CPU Base Counters

The `Zicntr` ISA extension adds the basic cycle `[m]cycle[h]`), instruction-retired (`[m]instret[h]`) and time (`time[h]`)
counters. This extensions is stated as _mandatory_ by the RISC-V spec. However, area-constrained setups may remove support for
these counters. Section <<_machine_counter_and_timer_csrs>> shows a list of all `Zicntr`-related CSRs.
These are available if the `Zicntr` ISA extensions is enabled via the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zicntr>> generic.

Additional CSRs:

* <<_cycleh>>, <<_mcycleh>> - cycle counter
* <<_instreth>>, <<_minstreth>> - instructions-retired counter
* <<_timeh>> - system _wall-clock_ time (driven by the <<_machine_system_timer_mtime>>)

[NOTE]
Disabling the `Zicntr` extension does not remove the `time[h]`-driving <<_machine_system_timer_mtime>>.

If the `Zicntr` ISA extension is disabled, all accesses to the according counter CSRs will raise an illegal instruction exception.


==== **`Zihpm`** Hardware Performance Monitors

In additions to the base cycle, instructions-retired and time counters the NEORV32 CPU provides
up to 29 hardware performance monitors (HPM 3..31), which can be used to benchmark applications. Each HPM consists of an
N-bit wide counter (split in a high-word 32-bit CSR and a low-word 32-bit CSR), where N is defined via the top's
<<_hpm_cnt_width>> generic (0..64-bit) and a corresponding event configuration CSR. The event configuration
CSR defines the architectural events that lead to an increment of the associated HPM counter. See the
<<_hpm_num_cnts>> documentation for a list of available trigger events.

The HPM counters are available if the `Zihpm` ISA extensions is enabled via the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zihpm>> generic.
The actual number of implemented HPM counters is defined by the <<_hpm_num_cnts>> generic.

Additional CSRs:

* <<_mhpmevent>> 3..31 (depending on <<_hpm_num_cnts>>) - event configuration CSRs
* <<_mhpmcounterh>> 3..31 (depending on <<_hpm_num_cnts>>) - counter CSRs

[IMPORTANT]
The HPM counter CSRs can only be accessed in machine-mode. Hence, the according <<_mcounteren>> CSR bits
are always zero and read-only. Any access from less-privileged modes will raise an illegal instruction
exception.

[TIP]
Auto-increment of the HPMs can be deactivated individually via the <<_mcountinhibit>> CSR.


==== **`Zifencei`** Instruction Stream Synchronization

The `Zifencei` CPU extension is implemented if the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zifencei>> configuration
generic is _true_. It allows manual synchronization of the instruction stream via the following instruction:

* `fence.i`

The `fence.i` instruction resets the CPU's front-end (instruction fetch) and flushes the prefetch buffer.
This allows a clean re-fetch of modified instructions from memory. Also, the top's `i_bus_fencei_o` signal is set
high for one cycle to inform the memory system (like the i-cache to perform a flush/reload.
Any additional flags within the `fence.i` instruction word are ignore by the hardware.


==== **`Zxcfu`** Custom Instructions Extension (CFU)

The `Zxcfu` presents a NEORV32-specific extension to the RISC-V ISA (`Z` = sub-extension, `x` = platform-specific
custom extension, `cfu` = name of the custom extension). When enabled via the <<_cpu_extension_riscv_zxcfu>> configuration
generic, this ISA extensions adds the <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>> to the CPU core. The CFU is a module that
allows to add **custom RISC-V instructions** to the processor core.

The CPU is implemented as additional ALU co-processor and is integrated right into the CPU's pipeline providing minimal
data transfer latency as it has direct access to the core's register file. The CFU utilizes the RISC-V `custom` opcodes
that have been explicitly reserved by the RISC-V spec for custom extensions.

Software can utilize the custom instructions by using _intrinsic_, which are basically inline assembly functions that
behave like regular C functions but that evaluate to a single custom instruction word (not calling overhead at all).

[TIP]
For more detailed information regarding the CFU, it's hardware and the according software interface
see section <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>>.

[TIP]
The CFU module / `Zxcfu` ISA extension is intended for user-defined **instructions**.
If you like to add more complex accelerators or interfaces that can also operate independently of
the CPU take a look at the memory-mapped <<_custom_functions_subsystem_cfs>>.


==== **`PMP`** Physical Memory Protection

The NEORV32 physical memory protection (PMP) provides an elementary memory protection mechanism that can be used
to constrain read, write and execute rights of arbitrary memory regions. The NEORV32 PMP is partly compatible
to the RISC-V Privileged Architecture Specifications.

In general, the PMP can **grant permissions to U mode**, which by default have none, and
can **revoke permissions from M-mode**, which by default has full permissions.

[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32 PMP only supports **TOR** (top of region) mode, which basically is a "base-and-bound" concept, and only
up to 16 PMP regions.

The physical memory protection logic is implemented if the <<_pmp_num_regions>> configuration generic is greater
than zero. This generic also defines the total number of implemented configurable region registers.
The minimal granularity of a protected region is defined by the <<_pmp_min_granularity>> generic. Larger
granularity will reduce hardware complexity but will also decrease the resolution.
The default value is 4 bytes, which allows a minimal region size of 4 bytes.

If implemented the PMP provides the following additional CSRs:

* <<_pmpcfg>> 0..3 (depending on configuration) - PMP configuration registers, 4 entries per CSR
* <<_pmpaddr>> 0..15 (depending on configuration) - PMP address registers

.PMP Example Program
[TIP]
A simple PMP example program can be found in `sw/example/demo_pmp`.

.Hardware Optimization
[TIP]
Reducing the minimal PMP region size / granularity via the <<_pmp_min_granularity>> top entity generic
will reduce hardware utilization and also reduces impact on critical path.

==== Traps, Exceptions and Interrupts

In this document the following nomenclature regarding traps is used:

* _interrupts_ = asynchronous exceptions
* _exceptions_ = synchronous exceptions
* _traps_ = exceptions + interrupts (synchronous or asynchronous exceptions)

Whenever an exception or interrupt is triggered, the CPU switches to machine-mode (if not already in machine-mode)
and transfers control to the address stored in <<_mtvec>> CSR. The cause of the according interrupt or exception can
be determined via the content of the <<_mcause>> CSR (a list of all possible `mcause` values and the according description
can be found below in section <<_neorv32_traplisting>. The address that reflects the current program counter when a trap
was taken is stored to <<_mepc>> CSR. Additional information regarding the cause of the trap can be retrieved from the
<<_mtval>> CSR and the processor's <<_internal_bus_monitor_buskeeper>> (for memory access exceptions).

All traps are prioritized. If several _synchronous exceptions_ occur at once only the one with highest priority is triggered
while all remaining exceptions are ignored. If several _asynchronous exceptions_ (interrupts) trigger at once, the one with highest priority
is serviced first while the remaining ones stay _pending_. After completing the interrupt handler the interrupt with
the second highest priority will get serviced and so on until no further interrupts are pending.

.Interrupts when in User-Mode
[IMPORTANT]
When the core is currently operating in less privileged user-mode, (machine-mode) interrupts are globally enabled
even if <<_mstatus>>`.mie` is cleared.

.Interrupt Signal Requirements - Standard RISC-V Interrupts
[IMPORTANT]
All standard RISC-V interrupts request signals are **high-active**. A request has to stay at high-level (=asserted)
until it is explicitly acknowledged by the CPU software (for example by writing to a specific memory-mapped register).

.Interrupt Signal Requirements - Fast Interrupt Requests
[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32-specific FIRQ request lines are triggered by a one-shot high-level (i.e. rising edge). Each request is buffered in the CPU control
unit until the channel is either disabled (by clearing the according <<_mie>> CSR bit) or the request is explicitly cleared (by writing
zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit).

.Instruction Atomicity
[NOTE]
All instructions execute as atomic operations - interrupts can only trigger _between_ two instructions.
So even if there is a permanent interrupt request, exactly one instruction from the interrupt program will be executed before
another interrupt handler can start. This allows program progress even if there are permanent interrupt requests.


:sectnums:
===== Memory Access Exceptions

If a load operation causes any exception, the instruction's destination register is
_not written_ at all. Load exceptions caused by a misalignment or a physical memory protection fault do not
trigger a bus/memory read-operation at all. Vice versa, exceptions caused by a store address misalignment or a store physical
memory protection fault do not trigger a bus/memory write-operation at all.


:sectnums:
===== Custom Fast Interrupt Request Lines

As a custom extension, the NEORV32 CPU features 16 fast interrupt request (FIRQ) lines via the `firq_i` CPU top
entity signals. These interrupts have custom configuration and status flags in the <<_mie>> and <<_mip>> CSRs and also
provide custom trap codes in <<_mcause>>. These FIRQs are reserved for NEORV32 processor-internal usage only.


:sectnums:
===== NEORV32 Trap Listing

The following table shows all traps that are currently supported by the NEORV32 CPU. It also shows the prioritization
and the CSR side-effects. A more detailed description of the actual trap triggering events is provided in a further table.

[NOTE]
_Asynchronous exceptions_ (= interrupts) set the MSB of <<_mcause>> while _synchronous exception_ (= "software exception")
clear the MSB.

**Table Annotations**

The "Prio." column shows the priority of each trap. The highest priority is 1. The "`mcause`" column shows the
cause ID of the according trap that is written to <<_mcause>> CSR. The "[RISC-V]" columns show the interrupt/exception code value from the
official RISC-V privileged architecture spec. The "ID [C]" names are defined by the NEORV32 core library (the runtime environment _RTE_) and can
be used in plain C code. The "`mepc`" and "`mtval`" columns show the value written to <<_mepc>> and <<_mtval>> CSRs when a trap is triggered:

* **IPC** - address of interrupted instruction (instruction has not been executed yet)
* **PC** - address of instruction that caused the trap (instruction has been executed)
* **ADR** - bad memory access address that caused the trap
* **0** - zero

.Resumable Exceptions
[WARNING]
Note that not all exceptions are resumable. For example, the "instruction access fault" exception or the "instruction address misaligned"
exception are not resumable in most cases. These exception might indicate a fatal memory hardware failure.

.Interrupt Trigger Type
[IMPORTANT]
The RISC-V standard interrupts (MEI, MSI and MTI) are **level-triggered and high-active**. Once set the signal has to stay high until
the interrupt request is explicitly acknowledged (e.g. writing to a memory-mapped register). The RISC-V standard interrupts
can **NOT** be acknowledged by writing zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit. +
+
In contrast, the NEORV32 fast interrupt request channels become pending after being triggering by **a rising edge**. A pending FIRQ has to
be explicitly cleared by writing zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit.

.Misaligned Instruction Address Exception
[NOTE]
For 32-bit-only instructions (= no `C` extension) the misaligned instruction exception
is raised if bit 1 of the fetch address is set (i.e. not on a 32-bit boundary). If the `C` extension is implemented
there will never be a misaligned instruction exception _at all_.
In both cases bit 0 of the program counter (and all related CSRs) is hardwired to zero.

==== Bus Interface

The NEORV32 CPU implements a 32-bit machine with separated instruction and data interfaces making the CPU a
**Harvard Architecture**: the _instruction fetch interface_ (`i_bus_*`) is used for fetching instructions and the
_data access interface_ (`d_bus_*`) is used to access data via load and store operations.
Each of these interfaces can access an address space of up to 2^32^ bytes (4GB).
The following table shows the signals of the data and instruction interfaces as seen from the CPU (`*_o` signals are driven
by the CPU / outputs, `*_i` signals are read by the CPU / inputs). Both interfaces use the same <<_protocol>>.

|=======================

.Pipelined Transfers
[NOTE]
Currently, there a no pipelined or overlapping operations (within the same bus interface) implemented.
So only a single transfer request can be "in fly" (pending) at once. However, this is no real drawback. The
minimal possible latency for a single access is two cycles, which is equal to the CPU's minimal execution latency
for a single instruction.

.Unaligned Memory Accesses
[NOTE]
Please note that the NEORV32 CPU does **not support the handling of unaligned memory accesses** in hardware. Any
unaligned memory access will raise an exception that can be used to handle unaligned accesses in _software_
(via emulation).

.Signal Stability
[NOTE]
All outgoing bus interface signals (driven by the CPU) remain _stable_ until the bus access is completed. This simplifies
the design of the bus interconnection network as well as the architecture of the individual processor modules.


:sectnums:
===== Protocol

A new bus request is triggered either by the `*_bus_re_o` signal (for reading data) or by the `*_bus_we_o` signal
(for writing data). In case of a request, one of these signals is high for exactly one cycle. The transaction is
completed when the accessed peripheral/memory either sets the `*_bus_ack_i` signal (-> successful completion) or the
`*_bus_err_i` signal (-> failed completion). These bus response signals have to be also set only for one cycle.
If a bus request is terminated by the `*_bus_err_i` signal the CPU will raise the according "instruction bus access fault" or
"load/store bus access fault" exception.


**Minimal Response Latency**

The transfer can be completed within in the same cycle as it was initiated (asynchronous response) if the accessed module
directly sets `*_bus_ack_i` or `*_bus_err_i` high for one cycle. However, in order to shorten the
critical path such an "asynchronous" response should be avoided. The default NEORV32 processor-internal modules use a registered
response with exactly **one cycle delay** between initiation and completion of transfers.


**Maximal Response Latency**

The processor-internal modules do not have to respond within one cycle after a bus request has been initiated.
However, the bus transaction has to be completed (= acknowledged) within a certain **response time window**. This time window
is defined by the global `max_proc_int_response_time_c` constant (default = 15 cycles; defined in the processor's VHDL package file
`rtl/neorv32_package.vhd`). It defines the maximum number of cycles after which an _unacknowledged_ (`*_bus_ack_i` or `*_bus_err_i`
signals both not set) transfer will time out and will raise a **bus fault exception**. The <<_internal_bus_monitor_buskeeper>> keeps
track of all _internal_ bus transactions to enforce this time window.

If any bus operations times out - for example when accessing "address space holes" - the BUSKEEPER will issue a bus
error to the CPU (via the according `*_bus_err_i` signal) that will raise the according instruction fetch or data access bus exception.
Note that **the bus keeper does not track external accesses via the external memory bus interface**. However,
the external memory bus interface also provides an _optional_ bus timeout
(see section <<_processor_external_memory_interface_wishbone_axi4_lite>>).

.Interface Response
[NOTE]
Please note that any CPU access via the data or instruction interface has to be terminated either by asserting the
CPU's *_bus_ack_i` or `*_bus_err_i` signal. Otherwise the CPU will be stalled permanently. The BUSKEEPER ensures that
any kind of access is always properly terminated.

| Read access | Write access
|=======================


**Write Access**

For a write access the according access address (`bus_addr_o`), the data to-be-written (`bus_wdata_o`) and the byte
enable identifier (`bus_ben_o`) are set when `bus_we_o` goes high. These three signals are kept stable until the
transaction is completed. In the example the accessed peripheral cannot answer directly within the next
cycle. Here, the transaction is successful and the peripheral sets the `bus_ack_i` signal _several_
cycles after issuing.


**Read Access**

For a read access the according access address (`bus_addr_o`) is set when `bus_re_o` goes high. The address is kept
stable until the transaction is completed. In the example the accessed peripheral cannot answer
directly within the next cycle. The peripheral hast to apply the read data right in the same cycle as
the bus transaction is completed (here, the transaction is successful and the peripheral sets the `bus_ack_i`
signal).


**Access Boundaries**

The instruction interface will always access memory on word (= 32-bit) boundaries even if fetching
compressed (16-bit) instructions. The data interface can access memory on byte (= 8-bit), half-word (= 16-
bit) and word (= 32-bit) boundaries, but not all processor module support sub-word accesses.


**Memory Barriers**

Whenever the CPU executes a `fence` instruction, the according interface signal is set high for one cycle
(`d_bus_fence_o` for a `fence` instruction; `i_bus_fence_o` for a `fence.i` instruction). It is the task of the
memory system to perform the necessary operations (for example a cache flush/reload).
