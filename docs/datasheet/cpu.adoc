== NEORV32 Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The NEORV32 CPU is an area-optimized RISC-V core implementing the `rv32i_zicsr_zifencei` base (privileged) ISA and
supporting several additional/optional ISA extensions. The CPU's micro architecture is based on a von-Neumann
machine build upon a mixture of multi-cycle and pipelined execution schemes.

[NOTE]
This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar with the official
RISC-V _User_ and _Privileged Architecture_ specifications.

=== RISC-V Compatibility

The NEORV32 CPU passes the tests of the **official RISCOF RISC-V Architecture Test Framework**. This framework is used to check
RISC-V implementations for compatibility to the official RISC-V user/privileged ISA specifications. The NEORV32 port of this
test framework is available in a separate repository at GitHub: https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof

.Unsupported ISA Extensions
[TIP]
Executing instructions or accessing CSRs from yet unsupported ISA extensions will raise an illegal
instruction exception (see section  <<_full_virtualization>>).


**Incompatibility Issues and Limitations**

.`time[h]` CSRs (Wall Clock Time)
[IMPORTANT]
The NEORV32 does not implement the `time[h]` registers. Any access to these registers will trap. It is
recommended that the trap handler software provides a means of accessing the platform-defined <<_machine_system_timer_mtime>>.

.No Hardware Support of Misaligned Memory Accesses
[IMPORTANT]
The CPU does not support resolving unaligned memory access by the hardware (this is not a
RISC-V-incompatibility issue but an important thing to know!). Any kind of unaligned memory access
will raise an exception to allow a _software-based_ emulation provided by the application. However, unaligned memory
access can be **emulated** using the NEORV32 runtime environment. See section <<_application_context_handling>>
for more information.

:sectnums:
=== Architecture

image::neorv32_cpu.png[align=center]

The CPU implements a pipelined multi-cycle architecture: each instruction is executed as a series of consecutive
micro-operations. In order to increase performance, the CPU's front-end (instruction fetch) and back-end
(instruction execution) are de-couples via a FIFO (the instruction prefetch buffer. Thus, the front-end can already
fetch new instructions while the back-end is still processing the previously-fetched instructions.

Basically, the CPU's micro architecture is somewhere between a classical pipelined architecture, where each stage
requires exactly one processing cycle (if not stalled) and a classical multi-cycle architecture, which executes
every single instruction (_including_ fetch) in a series of consecutive micro-operations. The combination of these
two design paradigms allows an increased instruction execution in contrast to a pure multi-cycle approach (due to
overlapping operation of fetch and execute) at a reduced hardware footprint (due to the multi-cycle concept).

As a Von-Neumann machine, the CPU provides independent interfaces for instruction fetch and data access. However,
these two bus interfaces are merged into a single processor-internal bus via a prioritizing bus switch (data accesses
have higher priority). Hence, _all_ memory addresses including peripheral devices are mapped to a single unified 32-bit
<<_address_space>>.

.Linear/In-Order Execution Only
[NOTE]
The CPU does not perform any speculative/out-of-order operations at all. Hence, it is not vulnerable to security issues
caused by speculative execution (like Spectre or Meltdown).


:sectnums:
==== CPU Register File

The data register file contains the general purpose architecture registers `x0` to `x31`. For the `rv32e` ISA only the lower
16 registers are implemented. Register zero (`x0`/`zero`) always read as zero and any write access to it has no effect.
Up to four individual synchronous read ports allow to fetch up to 4 register operands at once. The write and read accesses
are mutually exclusive as they happen in separate cycles. Hence, there is no need to consider things like "read-during-write"
behavior.

The register file provides two different implementation options configured via the top's `REGFILE_HW_RST` generic.

* `REGFILE_HW_RST = false` (default): In this configuration the register file is implemented as plain memory array without a
dictated hardware reset. This architecture allows to infer FPGA block RAM for the entire register file resulting in minimal
general logic utilization.
* `REGFILE_HW_RST = true`: This configuration is based on individual FFs that do provide a dedicated hardware reset.
Hence, the register cannot be mapped to FPGA block RAM. This optional can be selected if the application requires a
reset of the register file (e.g. for security reasons) or if the design shall be synthesized for an **ASIC** implementation.
Using individual FFs for th register file might also improve timing as no long routing lines are required to connect to
block RAM primitives.

The state of this configuration generic can be checked by software via the <<_mxisa>> CSR.

.FPGA Implementation
[WARNING]
Enabling the `REGFILE_HW_RST` option for FPGA implementation is not recommended as this will massively increase the amount
of required logic resources.

.Implementation of the `zero` Register within FPGA Block RAM
[NOTE]
Register `zero` is also mapped to a _physical memory location_ within the register file's block RAM. By this, there is no need
to add a further multiplexer to "insert" zero if reading from register `zero` reducing logic requirements and shortening the
critical path. However, this also requires that the physical storage bits of register `zero` are explicitly initialized (set
to zero) by the hardware. This is done transparently by the CPU control requiring no additional processing overhead.

.Block RAM Ports
[NOTE]
The default register file configuration uses two access ports: a read-only port for reading register `rs2` (second source operand)
and a read/write port for reading register `rs1` (first source operand) and for writing processing results to register `rd`
(destination register). Hence, a simple dual-port RAM can be used to implement the entire register file. From a functional point
of view, read and write accesses to the register file do never occur in the same clock cycle, so no bypass logic is required at all.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Arithmetic Logic Unit

The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) is used for actual data processing as well as generating memory and branch addresses.
All "simple" <<_i_isa_extension>> computational instructions (like `add` and `or`) are implemented as plain combinatorial logic
requiring only a single cycle to complete. More sophisticated instructions like shift operations or multiplications are processed
by so-called "ALU co-processors".

The co-processors are implemented as iterative units that require several cycles to complete processing. Besides the base ISA's
shift instructions, the co-processors are used to implement all further processing-based ISA extensions (e.g. <<_m_isa_extension>>
and <<_b_isa_extension>>).

.Multi-Cycle Execution Monitor
[NOTE]
The CPU control will raise an illegal instruction exception if a multi-cycle functional unit (like the <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>>)
does not complete processing in a bound amount of time (configured via the package's `monitor_mc_tmo_c` constant; default = 512 clock cycles).

.Tuning Options
[TIP]
The ALU architecture can be tuned for an application-specific area-vs-performance trade-off. The `FAST_MUL_EN` and `FAST_SHIFT_EN`
generics can be used to implement performance-optimized barrel shifters and DSP blocks, respectively. See sections <<_i_isa_extension>>,
<<_b_isa_extension>> and <<_m_isa_extension>> for specific examples.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Bus Unit

The bus unit takes care of handling data memory accesses via load and store instructions. It handles data adjustment when accessing
sub-word data quantities (16-bit or 8-bit) and performs sign-extension for singed load operations. The bus unit also includes the optional
<<_smpmp_isa_extension>> that performs permission checks for all data and instruction accesses.

A list of the bus interface signals and a detailed description of the protocol can be found in section <<_bus_interface>>.
All bus interface signals are driven/buffered by registers; so even a complex SoC interconnection bus network will not
effect maximal operation frequency.

.Unaligned Accesses
[WARNING]
The CPU does not support a hardware-based handling of unaligned memory accesses! Any unaligned access will raise a bus load/store unaligned
address exception. The exception handler can be used to _emulate_ unaligned memory accesses in software.
See the NEORV32 Runtime Environment's <<_application_context_handling>> section for more information.


:sectnums:
==== CPU Control Unit

The CPU control unit is responsible for generating all the control signals for the different CPU modules.
The control unit is split into a "front-end" and a "back-end".


**Front-End**

The front-end is responsible for fetching instructions in chunks of 32-bits. This can be a single aligned 32-bit instruction,
two aligned 16-bit instructions or a mixture of those. The instructions including control and exception information are stored
to a FIFO queue - the instruction prefetch buffer (IPB). This FIFO has a depth of two entries by default but can be customized
via the `ipb_depth_c` VHDL package constant.

The FIFO allows the front-end to do "speculative" instruction fetches, as it keeps fetching the next consecutive instruction
all the time. This also allows to decouple front-end (instruction fetch) and back-end (instruction execution) so both modules
can operate in parallel to increase performance. However, all potential side effects that are caused by this "speculative"
instruction fetch are already handled by the CPU front-end ensuring a defined execution stage while preventing security
side attacks.


**Back-End**

Instruction data from the instruction prefetch buffer is decompressed (if the `C` ISA extension is enabled) and sent to the
CPU back-end for actual execution. Execution is conducted by a state-machine that controls all of the CPU modules. The back-end also
includes the <<_control_and_status_registers_csrs>> as well as the trap controller.


==== Sleep Mode

The NEORV32 CPU provides a single sleep mode that can be entered to power-down the core reducing
dynamic power consumption. Sleep mode is entered by executing the `wfi` ("wait for interrupt") instruction.

.Execution Details
[NOTE]
The `wfi` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception when executed in user-mode
if `TW` in <<_mstatus>> is set. When executed in debug-mode or during single-stepping `wfi` will behave as
simple `nop` without entering sleep mode.

After executing the `wfi` instruction the CPU's `sleep_o` signal (<<_cpu_top_entity_signals>>) will become set
as soon as the CPU has fully halted ("CPU is sleeping"):

[start=1]
.The front-end (instruction fetch) has stopped. There is no pending instruction fetch bus access.
.The back-end (instruction execution) has stopped. There is no pending data bus access.
.There is no enabled interrupt being pending.

CPU-external modules like memories, timers and peripheral interfaces are not affected by this. Furthermore, the CPU will
continue to buffer/enqueue incoming interrupt. The CPU will leave sleep mode as soon as any _enabled_ interrupt (via <<_mie>>)
source becomes _pending_ or if a debug session is started.

===== Power-Down Mode

Optionally, the sleep mode can also be used to shut down the CPU's main clock to further reduce power consumption
by halting the core's clock tree. This clock gating mode is enabled by the `CLOCK_GATING_EN` generic
(<<_processor_top_entity_generics>>).  See section <<_processor_clocking>> for more information.


==== Full Virtualization

Just like the RISC-V ISA, the NEORV32 aims to provide _maximum virtualization_ capabilities on CPU and SoC level to
allow a high standard of **execution safety**. The CPU supports **all** traps specified by the official RISC-V
specifications. Thus, the CPU provides defined hardware fall-backs via traps for any expected and unexpected situations
(e.g. executing a malformed or not supported instruction or accessing a non-allocated memory address). For any kind
of trap the core is always in a defined and fully synchronized state throughout the whole system (i.e. there are no
out-of-order operations that might have to be reverted). This allows a defined and predictable execution behavior
at any time improving overall execution safety.


<<<
// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
=== Bus Interface

The NEORV32 CPU provides separated instruction fetch and data access interfaces making it a **Harvard Architecture**:
the instruction fetch interface (`i_bus_*` signals) is used for fetching instructions and the data access interface
(`d_bus_*` signals) is used to access data via load and store operations. Each of these interfaces can access an address
space of up to 2^32^ bytes (4GB).

The bus interface uses two custom interface types: `bus_req_t` is used to propagate the bus access **requests**. These
signals are driven by the _accessing_ device (i.e. the CPU core). `bus_rsp_t` is used to return the bus **response** and
is driven by the _accessed_ device or bus system (i.e. a processor-internal memory or IO device).

.Bus Interface - Request Bus (`bus_req_t`)
[cols="^1,^1,<6"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| Signal  | Width | Description
| `addr`  |    32 | Access address (byte addressing)
| `data`  |    32 | Write data
| `ben`   |     4 | Byte-enable for each byte in `data`
| `stb`   |     1 | Request trigger ("strobe", single-shot)
| `rw`    |     1 | Access direction (`0` = read, `1` = write)
| `src`   |     1 | Access source (`0` = instruction fetch, `1` = load/store)
| `priv`  |     1 | Set if privileged (M-mode) access
| `rvso`  |     1 | Set if current access is a reservation-set operation (`lr` or `sc` instruction, <<_zalrsc_isa_extension>>)
| `fence` |     1 | Data/instruction fence operation; valid without `stb` being set
|=======================

.Bus Interface - Response Bus (`bus_rsp_t`)
[cols="^1,^1,<6"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| Signal | Width | Description
| `data` |    32 | Read data (single-shot)
| `ack`  |     1 | Transfer acknowledge / success (single-shot)
| `err`  |     1 | Transfer error / fail (single-shot)
|=======================


:sectnums:
==== Bus Interface Protocol

Transactions are triggered entirely by the request bus. A new bus request is initiated by setting the _strobe_
signal `stb` high for exactly one cycle. All remaining signals of the bus are set together with `stb` and will
remain unchanged until the transaction is completed.

The transaction is completed when the accessed device returns a response via the response interface:
`ack` is high for exactly one cycle if the transaction was completed successfully. `err` is high for exactly
one cycle if the transaction failed to complete. These two signals are mutually exclusive. In case of a read
access the read data is returned together with the `ack` signal. Otherwise, the return data signal is
kept at all-zero allowing wired-or interconnection of all response buses.

The figure below shows three exemplary bus accesses:

[start=1]
. A read access to address `A_addr` returning `rdata` after several cycles (slow response; `ACK` arrives after several cycles).
. A write access to address `B_addr` writing `wdata` (fastest response; `ACK` arrives right in the next cycle).
. A failing read access to address `C_addr` (slow response; `ERR` arrives after several cycles).

.Three Exemplary Bus Transactions
image::bus_interface.png[700]

.Adding Register Stages
[TIP]
Arbitrary pipeline stages can be added to the request and response buses at any point to relax timing (at the cost of
additional latency). However, _all_ bus signals (request and response) need to be registered.


:sectnums:
==== Atomic Accesses

The load-reservate (`lr.w`) and store-conditional (`sc.w`) instructions from the <<_zalrsc_isa_extension>> execute as standard
load/store bus transactions but with the `rvso` ("reservation set operation") signal being set. It is the task of the
<<_reservation_set_controller>> to handle these LR/SC bus transactions accordingly. Note that these reservation set operations
are intended for processor-internal usage only (i.e. the reservation state is not available for processor-external modules yet).

.Reservation Set Controller
[NOTE]
See section <<_address_space>> / <<_reservation_set_controller>> for more information.

The figure below shows three exemplary bus accesses (1 to 3 from left to right). The `req` signal record represents
the CPU-side of the bus interface. For easier understanding the current state of the reservation set is added as `rvs_valid` signal.

[start=1]
. A load-reservate (LR) instruction using `addr` as address. This instruction returns the loaded data `rdata` via `rsp.data`
and also registers a reservation for the address `addr` (`rvs_valid` becomes set).
. A store-conditional (SC) instruction attempts to write `wdata1` to address `addr`. This SC operation **succeeds**, so
`wdata1` is actually written to address `addr`. The successful operation is indicated by a **0** being returned via
`rsp.data` together with `ack`. As the LR/SC is completed the registered reservation is invalidated (`rvs_valid` becomes cleared).
. Another store-conditional (SC) instruction attempts to write `wdata2` to address `addr`. As the reservation set is already
invalidated (`rvs_valid` is `0`) the store access fails, so `wdata2` is **not** written to address `addr` at all. The failed
operation is indicated by a **1** being returned via `rsp.data` together with `ack`.

.Three Exemplary LR/SC Bus Transactions
image::bus_interface_atomic.png[700]

.Store-Conditional Status
[NOTE]
The "normal" load data mechanism is used to return success/failure of the `sc.w` instruction to the CPU (via the LSB of `rsp.data`).

.Cache Coherency
[IMPORTANT]
Atomic operations **always bypass** the CPU caches using direct/uncached accesses. Care must be taken
to maintain data cache coherency (e.g. by using the `fence` instruction).

.RISC-V ISA Specification
[TIP]
For more information regarding the RISC-V ISA extensions please refer to the "RISC-V Instruction Set Manual - Volume
I: Unprivileged ISA" and "The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume II: Privileged Architecture". A copy of these
documents can be found in the projects `docs/references` folder.

.Discovering ISA Extensions
[TIP]
Software can discover available ISA extensions via the <<_misa>> and <<_mxisa>> CSRs or by executing an instruction
and checking for an illegal instruction exception (i.e. <<_full_virtualization>>).

.Instruction Cycles
[TIP]
This chapter shows the CPI values (cycles per instruction) for each individual instruction/type. Note that
values reflect _optimal conditions_ (i.e. no additional memory delay, no cache misses, no pipeline waits, etc.).
To benchmark a certain processor configuration for its setup-specific CPI value please refer to the
`sw/example/performance_tests` test programs.


==== `B` ISA Extension

The `B` ISA extension adds instructions for bit-manipulation operations.
This ISA extension cannot be enabled by a specific generic. Instead, it is enabled if a specific set of
bit-manipulation sub-extensions are enabled.

The `B` extension is shorthand for the following set of other extensions:

* <<_zba_isa_extension>> - Address-generation / shifted-add instructions.
* <<_zbb_isa_extension>> - Basic bit manipulation instructions.
* <<_zbs_isa_extension>> - Single-bit operations.

A processor configuration which implements `B` must implement all of the above extensions.


==== `C` ISA Extension

The "compressed" ISA extension provides 16-bit encodings of commonly used instructions to reduce code space size.

|=======================


==== `E` ISA Extension

The "embedded" ISA extensions reduces the size of the general purpose register file from 32 entries to 16 entries to
shrink hardware size. It provides the same instructions as the the base `I` ISA extensions.

.Alternative MABI
[NOTE]
Due to the reduced register file size an alternate toolchain ABI (`ilp32e*`) is required.


==== `I` ISA Extension

The `I` ISA extensions is the base RISC-V integer ISA that is always enabled.

|=======================

.`fence` Instruction
[NOTE]
The `fence` instruction word's _predecessor_ and _successor_ bits (used for memory ordering) are not evaluated
by the hardware at all. For the NEORV32 the `fence` instruction behaves exactly like the `fence.i` instruction
(see <<_zifencei_isa_extension>>). However, software should still use distinct `fence` and `fence.i` to provide
platform-compatibility and to indicate the actual intention of the according fence instruction(s).

.`wfi` Instruction
[NOTE]
The `wfi` instruction is used to enter <<_sleep_mode>>. Executing the `wfi` instruction in user-mode
will raise an illegal instruction exception if the `TW` bit of <<_mstatus>> is set.

.Barrel Shifter
[TIP]
The shift operations are implemented as multi-cycle ALU co-process (`rtl/core/neorv32_cpu_cp_shifter.vhd`).
These operations can be accelerated (at the cost of additional logic resources) by enabling the `FAST_SHIFT_EN`
configuration option that will replace the (time-variant) bit-serial shifter by a (time-constant) barrel shifter.


==== `M` ISA Extension

Hardware-accelerated integer multiplication and division operations are available via the RISC-V `M` ISA extension.
This ISA extension is implemented as multi-cycle ALU co-process (`rtl/core/neorv32_cpu_cp_muldiv.vhd`).

| Division       | `div` `divu` `rem` `remu`     | 36
|=======================

.DSP Blocks
[TIP]
Multiplication operations can be accelerated (at the cost of additional logic resources) by enabling the `FAST_MUL_EN`
configuration option that will replace the (time-variant) bit-serial multiplier by (time-constant) FPGA DSP blocks.


==== `U` ISA Extension

In addition to the highest-privileged machine-mode, the user-mode ISA extensions adds a second **less-privileged**
operation mode. Code executed in user-mode has reduced CSR access rights. Furthermore, user-mode accesses to the address space
(like peripheral/IO devices) can be constrained via the physical memory protection.
Any kind of privilege rights violation will raise an exception to allow <<_full_virtualization>>.


==== `X` ISA Extension

The NEORV32-specific ISA extensions `X` is always enabled. The most important points of the NEORV32-specific extensions are:
* The CPU provides 16 _fast interrupt_ interrupts (`FIRQ`), which are controlled via custom bits in the <<_mie>>
and <<_mip>> CSRs. These extensions are mapped to CSR bits, that are available for custom use according to the
RISC-V specs. Also, custom trap codes for <<_mcause>> are implemented.
* All undefined/unimplemented/malformed/illegal instructions do raise an illegal instruction exception (see <<_full_virtualization>>).
* There are <<_neorv32_specific_csrs>>.


==== `Zalrsc` ISA Extension

The `Zalrsc` ISA extension is a sub-extension of the RISC-V _atomic memory access_ (`A`) ISA extension and includes
instructions for reservation-set operations (load-reservate `lr` and store-conditional `sc`) only.
It is enabled by the top's <<_processor_top_entity_generics, `RISCV_ISA_Zalrsc`>> generic.

.AMO / `A` Emulation
[NOTE]
The atomic memory access / read-modify-write operations of the `A` ISA extension can be emulated using the
LR and SC operations (quote from the RISC-V spec.: "_Any AMO can be emulated by an LR/SC pair._").
The NEORV32 <<_core_libraries>> provide an emulation wrapper for emulating AMO/read-modify-write instructions that is
based on LR/SC pairs. A demo/program can be found in `sw/example/atomic_test`.

|=======================

.`aq` and `rl` Bits
[NOTE]
The instruction word's `aq` and `lr` memory ordering bits are not evaluated by the hardware at all.

.Atomic Memory Access on Hardware Level
[NOTE]
More information regarding the atomic memory accesses and the according reservation
sets can be found in section <<_reservation_set_controller>>.


==== `Zifencei` ISA Extension

The `Zifencei` CPU extension allows manual synchronization of the instruction stream. This extension is always enabled.

.NEORV32 Fence Instructions
[NOTE]
The NEORV32 treats both fence instructions (`fence` = data fence, `fence.i` = instruction fence) in exactly the same way.
Both instructions cause a flush of the CPU's instruction prefetch buffer and also send a fence request via the system
bus (see <<_bus_interface>>). This system bus fence operation will, for example, clear/flush all downstream caches.

==== `Zfinx` ISA Extension

The `Zfinx` floating-point extension is an _alternative_ of the standard `F` floating-point ISA extension.
It also uses the integer register file `x` to store and operate on floating-point data
instead of a dedicated floating-point register file. Thus, the `Zfinx` extension requires
less hardware resources and features faster context changes. This also implies that there are NO dedicated `f`
register file-related load/store or move instructions. The `Zfinx` extension'S floating-point unit is controlled
via dedicated <<_floating_point_csrs>>.
This ISA extension is implemented as multi-cycle ALU co-process (`rtl/core/neorv32_cpu_cp_fpu.vhd`).

.Fused / Multiply-Add Instructions
[WARNING]
Fused multiply-add instructions `f[n]m[add/sub].s` are not supported. A special GCC switch is used to prevent the
compiler from emitting contracted/fused floating-point operations (see <<_default_compiler_flags>>).

.Division and Squarer Root Instructions
[WARNING]
Division `fdiv.s` and square root `fsqrt.s` instructions are not supported yet.

.Subnormal Number
[WARNING]
Subnormal numbers ("de-normalized" numbers, i.e. exponent = 0) are not supported by the NEORV32 FPU.
Subnormal numbers are _flushed to zero_ setting them to +/- 0 before being processed by **any** FPU operation.
If a computational instruction generates a subnormal result it is also flushed to zero during normalization.

==== `Zicntr` ISA Extension

The `Zicntr` ISA extension adds the basic <<_cycleh>>, <<_mcycleh>>, <<_instreth>> and <<_minstreth>>
counter CSRs. Section <<_machine_counter_and_timer_csrs>> shows a list of all `Zicntr`-related CSRs.

.Time CSRs
[NOTE]
The user-mode `time[h]` CSRs are **not implemented**. Any access will trap allowing the trap handler to
retrieve system time from the <<_machine_system_timer_mtime>>.

.Mandatory Extension
[NOTE]
This extensions is stated as _mandatory_ by the RISC-V spec. However, area-constrained setups may remove
support for these counters.

.Constrained Access
[TIP]
User-level access to the counter CSRs can be constrained by the <<_mcounteren>> CSR.


==== `Zicond` ISA Extension

The `Zicond` ISA extension adds integer conditional move primitives that allow to implement branch-less
control flows. It is enabled by the top's <<_processor_top_entity_generics, `RISCV_ISA_Zicond`>> generic.
This ISA extension is implemented as multi-cycle ALU co-processor (`rtl/core/neorv32_cpu_cp_cond.vhd`).

==== `Zicsr` ISA Extension

This ISA extensions provides instructions for accessing the <<_control_and_status_registers_csrs>> as well as further
privileged-architecture extensions. This extension is mandatory and cannot be disabled. Hence, there is no generic
for enabling/disabling this ISA extension.

.Side-Effects if Destination is Zero-Register
[NOTE]
If `rd=x0` for the `csrrw[i]` instructions there will be no actual read access to the according CSR.
However, access privileges are still enforced so these instruction variants _do_ cause side-effects
(the RISC-V spec. state that these combinations "shall" not cause any side-effects).

|=======================


==== `Zihpm` ISA Extension

In additions to the base counters the NEORV32 CPU provides up to 13 hardware performance monitors (HPM 3..15),
which can be used to benchmark applications. Each HPM consists of an N-bit wide counter (split in a high-word 32-bit
CSR and a low-word 32-bit CSR), where N is defined via the top's `HPM_CNT_WIDTH` generic and a corresponding event
configuration CSR.

The event configuration CSR defines the architectural events that lead to an increment of the associated HPM counter.
See section <<_hardware_performance_monitors_hpm_csrs>> for a list of all HPM-related CSRs and event configurations.

.Machine-Mode HPMs Only
[NOTE]
Note that only the machine-mode hardware performance counter CSR are available (`mhpmcounter*[h]`).
Accessing any user-mode HPM CSR (`hpmcounter*[h]`) will raise an illegal instruction exception.

.Increment Inhibit
[TIP]
The event-driven increment of the HPMs can be deactivated individually via the <<_mcountinhibit>> CSR.


==== `Zba` ISA Extension

The `Zba` sub-extension is part of the _RISC-V bit manipulation_ ISA specification (<<_b_isa_extension>>)
and adds shifted-add / address-generation instructions. It is enabled by the top's

* <<_zbkb_isa_extension>> - Bit manipulation instructions for cryptography.
* <<_zbkc_isa_extension>> - Carry-less multiply instructions.

sub-extensions is enabled.

The `Zks` extension is shorthand for the following set of other extensions:

* <<_zbkb_isa_extension>> - Bit manipulation instructions for cryptography.
* <<_zbkc_isa_extension>> - Carry-less multiply instructions.
* <<_zbkx_isa_extension>> - Cross-bar permutation instructions.
* <<_zksed_isa_extension>> - SM4 block cipher instructions.
* <<_zksh_isa_extension>> - SM3 hash function instructions.

A processor configuration which implements `Zks` must implement all of the above extensions.


==== `Zksed` ISA Extension

The `Zksed` sub-extension is part of the _RISC-V scalar cryptography_ ISA specification and adds ShangMi block cypher
and key schedule instructions. It is enabled by the top's <<_processor_top_entity_generics, `RISCV_ISA_Zksed`>> generic.
This ISA extension is implemented as multi-cycle ALU co-processor (`rtl/core/neorv32_cpu_cp_crypto.vhd`).

==== `Zkt` ISA Extension

The `Zkt` sub-extension is part of the _RISC-V scalar cryptography_ ISA specification and guarantees data independent execution
times of cryptographic and cryptography-related instructions. The ISA extension cannot be enabled by a specific generic.
Instead, it is enabled implicitly by certain CPU configurations.

The RISC-V `Zkt` specifications provides a list of instructions that are included within this specification.
However, not all instructions are required to be implemented. Rather, every one of these instructions that the
core does implement must adhere to the requirements of `Zkt`.

==== `Zmmul` - ISA Extension

This is a sub-extension of the <<_m_isa_extension>> ISA extension. It implements only the multiplication operations
of the `M` extensions and is intended for size-constrained setups that require hardware-based
integer multiplications but not hardware-based divisions, which will be computed entirely in software.
Note that the <<_zmmul_isa_extension>> and <<_m_isa_extension>> are mutually exclusive.


==== `Zxcfu` ISA Extension

The `Zxcfu` presents a NEORV32-specific ISA extension. It adds the <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>> to
the CPU core, which allows to add custom RISC-V instructions to the processor core.
For detailed information regarding the CFU, its hardware and the according software interface
see section <<_custom_functions_unit_cfu>>.

Software can utilize the custom instructions by using _intrinsics_, which are basically inline assembly functions that
behave like regular C functions but that evaluate to a single custom instruction word (no calling overhead at all).

.CFU Execution Time
[NOTE]
The actual CFU execution time depends on the logic being implemented. The CPU architecture requires a minimal execution
time of 3 cycles (purely combinatorial CFU operation) and automatically terminates execution after 512 cycles if the CFU
does not complete operation within this time window.

|=======================


==== `Smpmp` ISA Extension

The NEORV32 physical memory protection (PMP) provides an elementary memory
protection mechanism that can be used to constrain read, write and execute rights of arbitrary memory regions.
The NEORV32 PMP is fully compatible to the RISC-V Privileged Architecture Specifications. In general, the PMP can
**grant permissions to user mode**, which by default has none, and can **revoke permissions from M-mode**, which
by default has full permissions. The PMP is configured via the <<_machine_physical_memory_protection_csrs>>.

Several <<_processor_top_entity_generics>> are provided to fine-tune the CPU's PMP capabilities:
* `PMP_NUM_REGIONS` defines the number of implemented PMP region
* `PMP_MIN_GRANULARITY` defines the minimal granularity of each region
* `PMP_TOR_MODE_EN` controls the implementation of the top-of-region (TOR) mode
* `PMP_NAP_MODE_EN` controls the implementation of the naturally-aligned-power-of-two (NA4 and NAPOT) modes

.PMP Rules when in Debug Mode
[NOTE]
When in debug-mode all PMP rules are ignored making the debugger have maximum access rights.

.Protected Instruction Fetches
[IMPORTANT]
New instruction fetches are **always triggered even when denied** by a certain PMP rule. However, the fetched instruction(s)
will not be executed and will not change CPU core state. Instead, they will raise a bus exception when reaching the CPU's
executions stage.


==== `Sdext` ISA Extension

This ISA extension enables the RISC-V-compatible "external debug support" by implementing
the CPU "debug mode", which is required for the on-chip debugger.
See section <<_on_chip_debugger_ocd>> / <<_cpu_debug_mode>> for more information.

==== `Sdtrig` ISA Extension

This ISA extension implements the RISC-V-compatible "trigger module".
See section <<_on_chip_debugger_ocd>> / <<_trigger_module>> for more information.

=== Traps, Exceptions and Interrupts

In this document the following terminology is used (derived from the RISC-V trace specification
available at https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-trace-spec):

* **exception**: an unusual condition occurring at run time associated (i.e. _synchronous_) with an instruction in a RISC-V hart
* **interrupt**: an external _asynchronous_ event that may cause a RISC-V hart to experience an unexpected transfer of control
* **trap**: the transfer of control to a trap handler caused by either an _exception_ or an _interrupt_

Whenever an exception or interrupt is triggered, the CPU switches to machine-mode (if not already in machine-mode)
and continues operation at the address being stored in the <<_mtvec>> CSR. The cause of the the trap can be determined via the
<<_mcause>> CSR. A list of all implemented `mcause` values and the according description can be found below in section
<<_neorv32_trap_listing>>. The address that reflects the current program counter when a trap was taken is stored to
<<_mepc>> CSR. Additional information regarding the cause of the trap can be retrieved from the <<_mtval>> and <<_mtinst>> CSRs.

The traps are prioritized. If several _exceptions_ occur at once only the one with highest priority is triggered
while all remaining exceptions are ignored and discarded. If several _interrupts_ trigger at once, the one with highest priority
is serviced first while the remaining ones stay _pending_. After completing the interrupt handler the interrupt with
the second highest priority will get serviced and so on until no further interrupts are pending.

.Interrupts when in User-Mode
[IMPORTANT]
If the core is currently operating in less privileged user-mode, interrupts are globally enabled
even if <<_mstatus>>.mie is cleared.

.Interrupt Signal Requirements - Standard RISC-V Interrupts
[IMPORTANT]
All interrupt request signals are **high-active**. Once triggered, a interrupt request line should stay high
until it is explicitly acknowledged by a source-specific mechanism (for example by writing to a specific memory-mapped register).

.Instruction Atomicity and Forward-Progress
[NOTE]
All instructions execute as atomic operations - interrupts can only trigger _between_ consecutive instructions.
Additionally, if there is a permanent interrupt request, exactly one instruction from the interrupted program will be executed before
another interrupt handler can start. This allows program progress even if there are permanent interrupt requests.


:sectnums:
==== Memory Access Exceptions

If a load operation causes any exception, the instruction's destination register is **not written** at all. Furthermore,
exceptions caused by a misaligned memory address a physical memory protection fault do not trigger a memory access request at all.

For 32-bit-only instructions (= no `C` extension) the misaligned instruction exception is raised if bit 1 of the fetch
address is set (i.e. not on a 32-bit boundary). If the `C` extension is implemented there will **never** be a misaligned
instruction exception at all.


:sectnums:
==== Custom Fast Interrupt Request Lines

As a custom extension, the NEORV32 CPU features 16 fast interrupt request (FIRQ) lines via the `firq_i` CPU top
entity signals. These interrupts have custom configuration and status flags in the <<_mie>> and <<_mip>> CSRs and also
provide custom trap codes in <<_mcause>>. These FIRQs are reserved for NEORV32 processor-internal usage only.


:sectnums:
==== NEORV32 Trap Listing

The following tables show all traps that are currently supported by the NEORV32 CPU. It also shows the prioritization
and the CSR side-effects.

**Table Annotations**

The "Prio." column shows the priority of each trap with the highest priority being 1. The "RTE Trap ID" aliases are
defined by the NEORV32 core library (the runtime environment _RTE_) and can be used in plain C code when interacting
with the pre-defined RTE function. The <<_mcause>>, <<_mepc>>, <<_mtval>> and <<_mtinst>> columns show the value being
written to the according CSRs when a trap is triggered:

* **I-PC** - address of intercepted instruction (instruction has _not_ been executed yet)
* **PC** - address of instruction that caused the trap (instruction has been executed)
* **ADR** - bad data memory access address that caused the trap
* **INS** - the transformed/decompressed instruction word that caused the trap
* **0** - zero
