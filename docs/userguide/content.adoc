Let's Get It Started!

This user guide uses the NEORV32 project _as is_ from the official `neorv32` repository.
To make your first NEORV32 project run, follow the guides from the upcoming sections. It is recommended to
follow these guides step by step and eventually in the presented order.

[TIP]
This guide uses the minimalistic and platform/toolchain agnostic SoC **test setups** from
`rtl/test_setups` for illustration. You can use one of the provided test setups for
your first FPGA tests. +

For more sophisticated example setups have a look at the
https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-setups[neorv32-setups] repository,
which provides **SoC setups** for various FPGAs, boards and toolchains.
