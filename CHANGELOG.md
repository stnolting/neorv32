## Project Change Log

The most recent **NEORV32** project version can be found on top of this list.
"Officially released" versions are linked and highlighted (:rocket:).
The latest release is [![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stnolting/neorv32)](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/releases).
A list of all releases can be found [here](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/releases). The most recent version of the *NEORV32 data sheet*
can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stnolting/neorv32/master/docs/NEORV32.pdf) (pdf).

The processor can determine its version from the `mimpid` CSR (at CSR address 0xf13). A 2x4-bit decimal-coded representation is used. Leading
zeros are optional. Example: `CSR(mimpid) = 0x01040312 -> 01.04.03.12 -> Version 1.4.3.12 = v1.4.3.12 = v01.04.03.12`

For the HDL sources the version number is globally defined by the `hw_version_c` constant in the main VHDL package file
[`rtl/core/neorv32_package.vhd`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/master/rtl/core/neorv32_package.vhd).
