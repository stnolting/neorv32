 🌍 FPGA-Based AI Accelerator with NEORV32 CFS
Research project integrating a custom FPGA-based neural network inference
accelerator with the NEORV32 RISC-V soft-core processor via the Custom
Functions Subsystem (CFS). The design features a tiled 4×4 matrix
multiplication engine, local BRAM buffering, FSM-based control, and
bare-metal C firmware for configuration and performance evaluation.
